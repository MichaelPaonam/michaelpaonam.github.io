Hi There! I am Michael.

## Welcome to my Personal Website

My name is Michael Paonam. I am currently working as a Backend Engineer at SAP, and actively involved with DevOps related tasks. This website started as a personal experiment to try out github pages and a cheap domain from [Namecheap](https://namecheap.com).

I'll be adding more content soon to showcase my skills and personal portfolio. This website ultimately aims to serve as my web CV.

## More to come. Thank you for being here.
